This README fole is describing Homework 2.

A couple of things that this project incorporated were: Bootstrap, Google fonts, rows & columns, and an external css file.

The Bootstrap css was linked in the head tag. I used it to pull down the Nav style. I also used the 12 column grid structure for the content container.

I also added a google font link to the head tag to incorporate the font Amarnth in the h1 tag.

Overall, I struggled with the layout and where to use the column and row grid elements. I could identify several places I would use them but wasn't condient if I should you it there. It seemed I could use css styles to accomplish the same tasks.

My external css doc describes several different elements I restyled. I worked to add a background image as my body style. Also, some height, width, padding, margin, background-color, and text colors.
