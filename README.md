#### Putting The First Week Together

Homework 2 README.md file

This README file is describing Homework 2, the challenges and getting close to the finished project.

A couple of things this homework project incorporated into the required pages (index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html), they were: BOOTSTRAP CSS FRAMEWORK, Google fonts, rows & columns, and an external css file.

The Bootstrap css was linked in the head tag. I used it to pull down the Navbar style. I also used the 12 column grid structure for the content container. The Bootstrap also allowed for a responsive layout and images on each page.

I also added a google font link to the head tag to incorporate the font Amaranth in the h1 tag.

Overall, I struggled with the layout and where to use the column and row grid elements and do 1 or 2 containers. I could identify several places I would use them but wasn't condient if I should you it there. It seemed I could use css styles to accomplish the same tasks.

My external css doc describes several different elements I restyled. I worked to add a background image as my body style. Also, some height, width, padding, margin, background-color, and text colors.

This project also required practing go between github.com repo, the local repo, and pushing back in which I tried to do 6+ times. I did have to look back at prior lectures to ensure I was getting it correct. Using VS to copy/paste the SSH code was easier than the git bash terminal for some reason.

Overall, I am satisfied with the result. I see I need to practice more with the responsiveness and making the accessibility better.
