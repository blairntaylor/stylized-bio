#### Putting The First Week Together

Homework 2 README.md file

This README file is describing Homework 2, the challenges and getting pretty close to the finished project.

The stylized-bio repo includes the files: index.html, portfolio. html, and contact.html.

The site layout and elements uses: Bootstrap for the navbar, the responsive layout, image. Additionally, it uses Google fonts, containers, rows & columns, and an external css file. The tag for media queries is also included in the external css for screens 800px and less.

The Bootstrap css was linked in the head tag. I used it to pull down the Navbar style. I also used the 12 column grid structure for the content container. The Bootstrap also allowed for a responsive layout and images on each page.

I also added a google font link to the head tag to incorporate the font Amaranth in the h1 tag.

Overall, I struggled with the layout and where to use the column and row grid elements and do 1 or 2 containers. I could identify several places I would use them but wasn't condient if I should you it there. It seemed I could use css styles to accomplish the same tasks.

My external css doc describes several different elements I restyled. I worked to add a background image as my body style. Also, some height, width, padding, margin, background-color, and text colors.

This project also required practing go between github.com repo, the local repo, and pushing back in to commit which I tried to do 6+ times. I did have to look back at prior lectures to ensure I was getting it correct. Using VS to copy/paste the SSH code was easier than the git bash terminal for some reason.

Overall, I am satisfied with the result. I see I need to practice more with the responsiveness and making the accessibility better.
